# Hello-World
MICTA Operational Space in Data Sciences.
My Name is Nkosinathi Goodman Nkosi, I Live in South Africa. I am interested in learning more about Data Sciences. I am currently working for a Non-Profit in IT Technical Project Management as well as teaching students ICT related programs. I have passion in working with young people and sharing my learned skills with them. It makes me find peace within me if I teach someone something new. I wish to develop an Algorithm that will manipulate data to find innovative solutions in understanding what people are thinking in their minds and to make a conlusive decisions based on the learned patterns. I want to explore what the future holds for us with the digital space.
